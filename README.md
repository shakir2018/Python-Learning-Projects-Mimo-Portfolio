Python Learning Projects – Mimo Portfolio
6 Hands-On Python Projects from My Mimo Journey
This repository showcases six practical projects I built while learning Python on the Mimo. Each one reflects the skills I gained progressively through the course.

#	Project Name
1	Transaction Analyzer- Analyze personal finance transactions: totals, averages, largest deposits/withdrawals.  
2	ChatGPT CLI Client- Interactive console chat with an OpenAI-compatible API (Mimo proxy).
3	Library Management System; OOP-based system to add, display, checkout, and return books.
4	Restaurant Food Order System- Simple CLI ordering system for Italian & Indian meals.
5	Star Wars API Explorer-  Fetch and explore data from SWAPI (people, planets, films, etc.).
6	ToDo List Manager (CLI)-  Add and remove tasks in a persistent console todo list.

Skills Mastered on Mimo
•	Variables & data types
•	Control flow (if/else, loops)
•	Functions & modular code
•	Lists & list comprehensions
•	Working with external APIs
•	Object-Oriented Programming
•	Error handling & user input
•	Building interactive CLI apps

How to Run
All projects are Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb). Open them in:
•	Google Colab (easiest – no setup)
•	VS Code + Jupyter extension
•	Jupyter Notebook/Lab

Dependencies:
Bash
pip install requests  # Required only for ChatGPT CLI and Star Wars API projects
For the ChatGPT project, set your API key:
Bash
export MIMO_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
These are my learning milestones — from basic logic to API integration and OOP. Proud of the progress!
